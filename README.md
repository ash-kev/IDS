# IDS
A basic and easy to understand cnn based model trained upon kd99 dataset to identify suspicious network behavior . 

A Machine Learning–based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that classifies network traffic as Normal or Attack using a Neural Network trained on the KDD99 / NSL-KDD dataset.

# Features

-Binary intrusion detection (Normal vs Attack)
-End-to-end ML pipeline (Data → Preprocessing → Model → Evaluation)
-Handles numeric + categorical network features
-Class imbalance handling using class weights
-Early stopping to prevent overfitting
